Inspired by [Patrik Loeber's video](https://youtu.be/xl0N7tHiwlw?si=ztHOC9WYnfWwAxzy), I recreated a simple Regression Model using Stack Overflow's 2023 Developer Survey data. I trained and tested the model, then published it to Streamlit.

* What I learned:
    * Creating Regression Model.
    * Exporting Machine Learning Models with Pickle.
    * Publishing a Machine Learning Model with Streamlit
    * Publishing Data-Viz to Streamlit.
