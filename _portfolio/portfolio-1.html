<p> Inspired by Davide Chicco & Giuseppe Jurman's <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5">research</a>, my thesis project focused on improving the performance of ML models in predicting patient survival. For this project, I used two datasets. The first one is Chicco & Jurmanâ€™s original dataset found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data">Kaggle</a>. This dataset is called SOLE DATASET. </p>

<p> The second dataset was retrieved from Zhang et al. on <a href="https://physionet.org/content/heart-failure-zigong/1.3/">PhysioNet</a>. The second dataset was then combined with Chicco & Jurman's dataset, producing a second dataset called COMBINED DATASET. </p>

Both SOLE and COMBINED dataset were divided into 3 splits, 60/40, 70/30, and 80/20. Each split was used in 5 different way. 1 without resampling, and 4 with resampling (RUS, ROS,SMOTE, ADASYN). Each dataset was then be used with SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest algorithms, and evaluated with 2 evaluation types:
<!-- <ul>
    <li>with Cross Validation</li>
    <li>without Cross Validation</li>
</ul> -->

With all these different configurations, the best model is achieved with XGBoost. It used 70/30 split of the SOLE DATASET with no resampling, used CrossVal, and achieved 91.11% accuracy, 87.50% recall, and 93.99% AUC.
